  <h2 class="flashy">About Fupas</h2>
  <p>Cupcakes are known today as teeny, delectable desserts. But did you know that cupcakes have been around since the 19th century? Then, they were made with simple cake recipes, and they were far from the decadent desserts we can find today. Although classic vanilla with chocolate icing options are still popular and evoke a sense of nostalgia, upscale bakeries and even people who bake for a hobby have created elaborate flavors with even more elaborate options for design.</p>
